#  This is usually recommended as it avoids having a huge shared tablespace
# and as it allows you to reclaim space when you drop or truncate a table.
# Separate tablespace also benefits for Xtrabackup partial backup scheme.

# InnoDB relies heavily on the buffer pool and should be set correctly,
# so be sure to allocate enough memory to it.
# Typically a good value is 70%-80% of available memory.
# More precisely, if you have RAM bigger than your dataset setting it bit
# larger should be appropriate with that keep in account of your database growth
# and re-adjust innodb buffer pool size accordingly.

# Innodb writes changed data record into lt’s log buffer, which kept in memory
# and it saves disk I/O for large transactions as it not need to write the log
# of changes to disk before transaction commit.
# 4 MB – 8 MB is good start unless you write a lot of huge blobs.

# Useful in highly concurrent workload as it may reduce contention of the global mutexes.

# With improvements to the InnoDB engine, it is recommended to allow the engine to control
# the concurrency by keeping it to default value (which is zero).
# If you see concurrency issues, you can tune this variable.
# A recommended value is 2 times the number of CPUs plus the number of disks.
# It’s dynamic variable means it can set without restarting MySQL server.
